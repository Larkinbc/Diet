    "The goal of the Diet Problem is to select foods that satisfy daily nutritional requirements at minimum cost. This problem can be formulated as a linear program, for which constraints limit the number of calories and the amount of vitamins, minerals, fats, sodium, and cholesterol in the diet. Danzig (1990) notes that the diet problem was motivated by the US Army's desire to minimize the cost of feeding GIs in the field while still providing a healthy diet.\n",
